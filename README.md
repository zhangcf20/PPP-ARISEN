# PPP-ARISEN

For the geoscience community, a cross-platform open source PPP toolbox named PPP-ARISEN is developed, which can realize Ambiguity Resolution (AR) based on Integer Phase Clock (IPC) method with Satellite-to-satellite Single Difference (SSD) strategy and now is compatible with both CODE (Center for Orbit Determination in Europe) and CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) AR products. The toolbox can achieve millimeter-level precision for static positioning and centimeter-level precision for kinematic mode, while the uniquely designed "Seismological" mode successfully captures clear dynamic signals induced by the earthquake with different products of IGS analysis centers. Moreover, an effective index called CSI-ZWDV (Convergence Status Indicator based on Zenith Wet Delay Variances) with clear physical meaning, has been proposed and validated. It could not only determine when to search for the integer ambiguities with LAMBDA method, but also indicate the convergence status of PPP, as a distinctive alternative to experimental parameters used independently or jointly with existing indices or thresholds.
